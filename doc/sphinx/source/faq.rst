How to get help or report an issue ?
------------------------------------

.. There is no mailing list or forum actually, so you can either contact me or fill an issue on Github.

If you want to **discuss or ask questions on @package_name@**, you can subscribe and post messages on the
**@package_name@ User** mailing list.

There is actually three lists running on Google Groups (*):

`User List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/@project_name@-user>`_
  List for @package_name@ users
`Announce List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/@project_name@-announce>`_
  List for announcements regarding @package_name@ releases and development
`Devel List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/@project_name@-devel>`_
  List for developers of @package_name@

**If you encounter an issue, please fill an issue** on the `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/FabriceSalvaire/@package_name@/issues>`_.

(*) Despite Google Groups has many drawbacks, I don't have actually enough resources to run GNU Mailman or
Discourse on my own IT infrastructure.
